# qr_code_generation

Apologies in advance for the crappy doco, writting this in the development process so that I do not forget what on earth I am doing mid process. 

generate_qr.py is a script which is reusable which can be utilized for any QR code generation by replacing the URL and Asset Name. 

Two images one JPEG and one WEBP is created by this (the asset).
